# Pi Zero Robot

The goal with the Pi Zero Robot is to have a customisable robot platform that can be easily adapted to any robot project.

All you require to make one is a Raspberry Pi Zero, a 16 Channel PWM Servo Motor driver, some 2020 extrusion (Aluminium or 3D printed), access to a 3D printer and your imagination.

The actual configuration of the robot is up to you - a single 2020 bar, or a larger structure with multiple bars for a bigger robot. My personal goal is to make a robot lawn mower, but I wanted to start with something smaller than I can expand over time.

You'll find the latest stable STLs at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3061928 - as the project progresses, tested 3D parts will be placed there.

Once I've assembled the first robot, code will be added. I intend to take advantage of http://johnny-five.io/.

If you'd like to contribute to this project, please do.
